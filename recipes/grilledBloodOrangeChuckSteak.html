        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I've been experimenting with marinades for years. This recipe is the result of the combined efforts of several friends and a few cookbook recipes.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup blood orange marmalade</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup prepared mojo criollo dressing</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons orange juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons grated orange zest</li>
            <li>2 pounds beef chuck steak</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix marmalade, water, soy sauce, mojo criollo dressing, brown sugar, orange juice, ginger, garlic powder, and orange zest in a bowl. Measure 1 cup marinade and pour into a large resealable plastic bag; add beef to bag. Seal bag and turn beef inside bag to coat completely. Marinate in refrigerator, turning occasionally, for at least 8 hours to overnight. Cover bowl with remaining marinade and refrigerate.</li>
            <li>Remove beef from marinade; discard used marinade.</li>
            <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Grill beef on the preheated grill, basting frequently with reserved marinade, until desired doneness is reached, 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
