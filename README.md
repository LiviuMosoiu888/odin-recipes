# odin-recipes

This is my first project from the "The Odin Project" journey.

Until now, I have went through the Git Basics and HTML Foundations chapters, with notes saved in Obsidian.

Note for self: Check the Obsidian repository (Private) to review the notes in case you are not using my own laptop
